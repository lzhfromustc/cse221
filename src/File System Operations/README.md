# File System Operations
To run our code, you can just use make to get the compiled file.

## Cache size

You should give the size of the file and the file path.

## File read

You should give the size of the file and the file path. There are two file named sequential_read and random_read.

## Remote File read
The same as previour one, you need to give that two to file_read, which we put them together.

## Contention
For contention, you should give the number of process you want to create. Also, you need to change the file name in the source code. 

## File creation
We have a python3 file generator inside cache_size and file_4_read. So you can run it to generate a random binaray file to test our code.
